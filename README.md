This program draws points along individual sine waves to demonstrate multithreading. Rendering is performed in one thread, calculations in another. 

To increase the amount of objects drawn onto the screen, press `w`. To decrease, press `s`. To reset the number of points to 0, press `r`.

Uses Rich Newman's C# HSL color class. Code can be found [here](https://richnewman.wordpress.com/about/code-listings-and-diagrams/hslcolor-class/).
